 ## 67. Add Binary
 ## 190. Reverse Bits
 ```py
 class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for _ in range(32):
            res <<= 1
            res |= n & 1
            n >>= 1
        return res
 ```
For each bit position from `0` to `31`, we perform the following steps:

1. Left shift `res` by 1 position (`res <<= 1`): This shifts the bits of res to the left, making room for the next bit.

2. Set the least significant bit of `res` with the current bit of `n` (`res |= n & 1`): This performs a bitwise OR operation between `res` and the least significant bit of `n`. It sets the corresponding bit in `res` to the same value as the current bit of `n`.

3. Right shift `n` by 1 position (`n >>= 1`): This shifts the bits of `n` to the right, moving to the next bit position.

By repeating these steps for all `32` bit positions, we effectively reverse the bits of the input `n`.

 ## 287. Find the Duplicate Number
 - bit
 ```py
 class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        bitmask = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if bitmask & (1 << num):
                return num
            bitmask |= (1 << num)
        
        return -1

        # time: O(n)
        # space: O(1)
 ```
The expression `bitmask & (1 << num)` is used to check whether a specific bit is set in the bitmask variable.

Let's break down the expression:

`(1 << num)`: This performs a left shift operation (`<<`) on the number 1 by num positions. In other words, it sets the num-th bit to 1 and leaves all other bits as 0. For example, if `num` is `2`, `(1 << num)` will result in binary representation `0b100` (4 in decimal).

`bitmask & (1 << num)`: This performs a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between the bitmask variable and the result of the left shift operation. It compares the corresponding bits of the `bitmas`k and `(1 << num)` values.

If the `num`-th bit in `bitmask` and `(1 << num)` are both `1`, the result of the bitwise AND operation will have that bit set to `1`. This indicates that the bit is already set in the `bitmask`, suggesting the presence of a duplicate element.

If the `num`-th bit in either `bitmask` or `(1 << num)` is `0`, the result of the bitwise AND operation will have that bit set to `0`. This implies that the bit is not set in the `bitmask`, indicating that the current element is not a duplicate.

Therefore, by checking whether the result of `bitmask & (1 << num)` is non-zero, we can determine if a specific bit is set in the `bitmask` variable. If it is non-zero, it means that the bit is already set and indicates the presence of a duplicate element.
